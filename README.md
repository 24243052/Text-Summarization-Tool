DESCRIPTION:

A Text Summarization Tool is an Artificial Intelligence–based application designed to automatically convert long pieces of text into short, meaningful summaries while preserving the core idea and important points. This tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the context of the input text and generate a concise version that is easy to read and understand. It is especially useful in today’s digital world where large volumes of information need to be processed quickly.
TOOLS USED:
Python Programming Language:
Python is used as the core programming language for developing the text summarization tool. It is widely used in AI and machine learning because of its simplicity, readability, and availability of powerful libraries.
Hugging Face Transformers Library:
The tool uses the Transformers library to perform text summarization. Specifically, the sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 pre-trained model is used. This model is based on the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) architecture and is optimized for summarizing long documents such as articles, reports, and essays. It applies an abstractive summarization approach, meaning it generates new sentences instead of just extracting lines from the original text.
Streamlit Framework:
Streamlit is used to create the user interface (UI) of the application. It allows developers to build interactive web applications using simple Python scripts. Features such as text input boxes, sliders for summary length, buttons, and result display are implemented using Streamlit, making the tool user-friendly and visually clean.
Editor Platform:
The application can be developed using editors such as VS Code.
Execution Platform:
The tool runs as a web-based application using Streamlit. It can be executed locally on a computer or deployed on cloud platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud, allowing access from any browser without installation.
Applications of the Text Summarization Tool:
Education: Summarizing textbooks, notes, and research papers
Business: Creating executive summaries of reports and proposals
Media & Journalism: Condensing news articles and blog posts
Legal & Medical Fields: Summarizing long documents and case files
Students & Professionals: Quick revision and information extraction
